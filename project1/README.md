# Connect Four Game in PHP

### File intentions
* Info: This file will give information about the board but does not actually do anything functional
* New: This file will create a new game and a new file to save the state of the game
* Play: Allows the player to input a move, alters the board accordingly, and saves the altered board in a file
* Board: Contains board, and functions to interact with the board (game logic)
* commFunctions: Common functions: `makeError($msg)` and `addToTextDoc($pid, $jsonstring)`

### For Eric
**I finished writing it but I have not tested anything yet. Please test everything and fix any bugs you can find.**
Thanks,
Martin
